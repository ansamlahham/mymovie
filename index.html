     The Greatest Showman true story confirms that Barnum's American Museum burned to the ground in a fire on July 13, 1865. The origin of the fire was never discovered. However, his addition of pro-Unionist lectures, exhibits and dramas had incited a Confederate arsonist to start a fire there the year prior.

    The biggest criticism of The Greatest Showman was that it whitewashed P.T. Barnum's story and his controversial history in favor of an inclusive message and broader appeal - a criticism that has also been leveled at Hamilton since its release on Disney.
